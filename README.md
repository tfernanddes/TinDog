<h1>TinDog</h1>

Is your dog barking at the door all day?  Is he ruining all the furniture because doesn't have a friend to play with? 
Well, he/she needs a lifetime partner (or just a friend to hangout with and have a milk-bone peanut butter treat). 

We have the solution for you! TinDog !

Used CSS and HTML for this landing page.

Also, I made it is fully responsible using Bootstrap.
